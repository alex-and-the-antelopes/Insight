# Insight ⚖️

Server for insight, a parliamentary bill tracker application, making democracy accessible to everyone.
This is a year-long project in a team of 7 to develop a system to solve a problem, for the *Integrated group-based project* unit at University of Bath 🛁.

## Installation
This project has not been developed as a "product" in anyway, but these are the general steps, should you wish to use
this code.

1. Download source code as zip
2. Extract contents to a new folder
3. Ensure all modules in `/requirements.txt` are installed (and the correct version number)
4. Install [ParlPy](https://github.com/Litharge/ParlPy).
5. Add a file named `/email_details.py` with the contents:
    ```python
    # Holds the details for the gmail account
    email_address = "bills@example.com"
    password = "hunter2"
    ```
6. Setup MySQL database
> **Note:** Although config files for use with Google Cloud Platform are included, ensure `entrypoint` in `app.yaml` is 
> set to point to `app.py`.

## Taken from a Deliverable
A system to allow users to both learn about and react to bills passing through Parliament, ultimately encouraging users to engage in the political process. We plan on using a social media style interface to present the bills and allow users to react, to provide young people with a familiar and modern interface to the political process. However, we simultaneously aim to make the interface formal enough that the content is engaged with in a meaningful way.

Our system aims to tackle the growing trend of political disengagement in the UK [1], particularly among younger people. Our system exposes the user to the movement of bills through the Houses of Parliament, including the decisions of MP’s and Lords at readings. The system will highlight the real political decisions of the user’s local MP in particular, drawing from the primary source of the Parliamentary websites - important when trust in the credibility of politicians fluctuates around 9% [2].

Our system is focussed on users within the UK, as the political process varies widely around the world, so other countries would require their own interactive systems. We have read further into the UK’s political process and engaged with representative potential users to gain insight into their goals and design opinions when designing our interface.

## Unit Aims
Taken from the [unit description](http://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2016-2017/cm/CM20257.html):

> This unit aims to: 
> * develop the technical, management and teamworking skills necessary for the successful development of a multidisciplinary software project. 
> * build on concepts taught within Computing as a Science and Engineering Discipline. 
> * provide a systems-based understanding of data and information, data modelling, storage, access, retrieval and protection. 
> * build upon the fundamental concepts of networking and prepare students for networking terminology and concepts they may meet on placement.
